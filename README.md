# Sortify - Sorting Made Easy

Welcome to Sortify, a simple and extensible sorting algorithm repository where sorting is made easy! Feel free to download or clone the repository, make changes, and add your own sorting algorithms.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with Sortify:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/avishkar2001/Sortify.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the Sortify directory:

    ```bash
    cd Visualizer
    ```

## Sorting Algorithms

Sortify currently includes the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature-youralgorithm
    ```

3. Add your sorting algorithm implementation or make improvements.
4. Commit your changes:

    ```bash

    git push origin feature-youralgorithm
    ```

6. Create a pull request.

## Adding a New Sorting Algorithm

To add a new sorting algorithm:

1. Create a new file for your algorithm in the `src/algorithms` directory.
2. Implement your sorting algorithm.
3. Update the `README.md` with information about your algorithm.

Feel free to add comments and documentation to make your code understandable to others.
